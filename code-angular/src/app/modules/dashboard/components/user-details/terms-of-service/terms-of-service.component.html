    <strong>No Warranties</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    The website is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Aiforyou, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the website, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
    <br><br>
    Without limitation to the foregoing, Aiforyou provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the website will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Aiforyou and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the website.
    <br><br>
    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Aiforyou or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the website, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the website, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Aiforyou or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
    <br><br>
    Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Severability</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

    This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by Aiforyou on the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Aiforyou concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Aiforyous failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND Aiforyou AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Waiver</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.
    <br><br>
    No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.
    <br>
    <br>
